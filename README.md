# DoYouWannaGoOutWithMe
## A website to invite your lover for a date 🥰 

### Features - 
1. ***💖 User-friendly Interface:*** The website provides a charming and easy-to-use interface, making the process of asking your crush out a fun experience. A snazzy homepage and an "Ask Out" button that's just begging to be clicked! 
2. ***🔗 Generate Unique Shareable Link:***  Enter your crush's name, and get a unique link (each link expires in 24hrs). Send it to your crush and watch the magic unfold!
3. ***🌐 Dynamic Page Routes:*** Clean and dynamic page routes.
4. ***🙅🏻‍♀️ Yes or No Options:*** Your crush gets two options - "Yes" or "No." But be warned, the "No" button is a bit of a trickster - it wiggles away, leaving only room for positivity!
6. ***🥳 Celebration Page:*** Clicking "Yes" redirects to a cute celebration page, because every affirmative answer deserves a dance.
